# These are the steps to collect ODC(OneData Collector) Logs in a windows device.

These help troubleshoot issues with BitLocket, Update Rings among others.

# 1. Run PowerShell as the standard user and run these commands one by one:

```terminal`
md c:\IntuneODCLogs

Set-Location c:\IntuneODCLogs

wget https://aka.ms/intunexml -outfile Intune.xml

wget https://aka.ms/intuneps1 -outfile IntuneODCStandAlone.ps1

PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\IntuneODCStandAlone.ps1

- We give it about 10min to collect necessary info and then create a compressed file to **c:\IntuneODCLogs**
